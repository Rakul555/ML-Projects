Machine Learning Projects for Restaurant Dataset
This repository contains three machine learning projects focused on analyzing and predicting restaurant data. Each project tackles a unique aspect of restaurant data analysis using different machine learning techniques.

Project 1: Predicting Aggregate Ratings
Objective
Build a machine learning model to predict the aggregate rating of a restaurant based on various features such as location, cuisine type, price range, etc.

Dataset
Features: Location, cuisine type, price range, etc.
Target: Aggregate rating of the restaurant

Approach
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and encoding the categorical variables, handling missing values, and scaling the features.
Feature Engineering: Extracting meaningful features for rating prediction.

Model Selection:Linearn regression.
Evaluation: Using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate model performance.

Output
A machine learning model capable of predicting restaurant ratings based on other provided features.




Project 2: Restaurant Recommendation System
Restaurant Recommendation System
This project aims to create a restaurant recommendation system that suggests restaurants to users based on their preferences. The system uses collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid approaches to tailor recommendations to each user's taste.

Objective
Build a machine learning model that recommends restaurants to users based on their preferences, past interactions, or similar user profiles.

Dataset
Features: User preferences, ratings, cuisine type, location, price range, etc.
Target: Generate personalized restaurant recommendations for each user.
Approach

Data Preprocessing:Clean and prepare the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and standardizing features.
Analyze user interactions and preferences for a better understanding of user behavior.
Recommendation Techniques:

Collaborative Filtering: Suggests restaurants based on user similarity.
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends restaurants based on features (e.g., cuisine type, location) that align with a userâ€™s known preferences.
Hybrid Approach: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering to provide more comprehensive recommendations.

Output
A recommendation system that suggests relevant restaurants to users based on their preferences and past behavior, enhancing the dining experience with personalized recommendations.




Project 3: Geographical Analysis of Restaurants
Objective
Perform a geographical analysis of the restaurants in the dataset to identify trends and patterns based on location.

Dataset
Features: Latitude, longitude,Locality,Locality Verbose,cuisine type.

Approach
Data Exploration: Visualizing the spatial distribution of restaurants and analyzing popular areas for different cuisine types.
Clustering: Applying clustering algorithms like K-means to find common clusters of restaurant types or cuisines.
Mapping: Using visualization libraries (e.g., Folium, Geopandas) to create interactive maps.
Output
Geospatial insights into restaurant locations, identifying popular regions, and visualizing cuisine type distribution across areas.
